# CMake toolchain file: build LLVM (the *library*) for wasm32-wasip1.
#
# This is the artifact Crystal's compiler needs. Crystal only ever emits
# wasm32-unknown-wasi (it has no Emscripten target), so the libLLVM the compiler
# links must itself be wasm32-wasi -- not Emscripten, not native.
#
# Used by build.sh stage B (`cmake -S llvm -B build-wasi`). Stage A builds the
# host `llvm-tblgen` natively; its path is passed as -DLLVM_TABLEGEN.
#
# WASI_SDK must point at an extracted wasi-sdk (33.0 verified).
